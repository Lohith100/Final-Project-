# "âˆž Space "

"âˆž Space" is a game which completely based on "gd script" which is almost identical to "python".

- This is a endless type space game thats why choose it's name as "âˆžspace"

in this i choose a spaceship as "player" and some small "enemy space ship" as enemies and some obstacles like planets, fire asteroids....

#### how to play
- use the arrow keys in keyboard to move the player space ship in up,down,left,right
- avoid the obstacles like enemy ships, planets....
- if player collided with any of these then the game will restarts
#### score system
- player can score more while going forward and avoid obstacles
- score system is like in subwaysurfers,templerun other endless game types .

## Documentation
- godot Documentation to learn how to use godot

[Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/index.html)


## Lessons Learned

i learned how to code to detect collisions of a kinematic 3d body and restart a current scene using "if" condition

i faced problem on graphics and performance effect .I noticed there is a massive lag and drop in framerate while using more than 1 directional light


## Optimizations


-  I first use GLSE3 to get good graphics but my aim is to make it runable on every system even in low end devices too
-  I use GLSE2 and optimize graphics but anyone have good hardware they can use high quality animations too
-  I fix the lag by optimize shadows,lights... to get good framerate
-  In code i try to reduce _physics_process functions to get better experience

## Roadmap

- you need to install godot game engine to run it



## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone <url of this page>
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd project
```

open the game folder "Infinite space" in godot as a project


- don't edit the folders,files paths

## Screenshots

- some Screenshots of the game

```bash
   check /project/images
```
